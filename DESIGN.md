# AI System Design

These are suggested components/structures that may be used when implementing the AI agents.

## Learning Agents

Broken into 4 different sections, consider a taxi driver agent:

**Performance element**: you want to go into Perth? Let’s take Winthrop Avenue, it’s worked well previously.
**Problem generator**: nah, let’s try Mounts Bay Road for a change – it may be better.
**Critic element**: great, it was five minutes quicker, and what a nice view!
**Learning element**: yeah, in future we’ll take Mounts Bay Road.

## A 'Jack' Bot

Let me play as the human bot BUT memorise my choices. Then use that memory to determine it's future decisions.
